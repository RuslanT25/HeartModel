❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction
Random Forest & Logistic Regression with ML.NET (.NET / ASP.NET Core MVC)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning–powered web application designed to predict heart disease risk based on patient clinical and demographic data.
Two different models are implemented and compared:
  Random Forest (FastForest – ML.NET)
  Logistic Regression (LBFGS)
The system outputs:
  Binary classification (Disease: YES / NO)
  Probability score (Risk percentage)
The application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC and ML.NET, providing a real-time prediction interface
